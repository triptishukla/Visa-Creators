Even with its looming way out from the European Union, the nation has successfully turned out to be a home to multiple affluent 500 companies including Vodafone, Rolls-Royce, Unilever, and HSBC. The education system in the UK boasts of some of the best universities in the world including Oxford University which was started in 1096 AD, almost a millennium ago.</p>

									

									

									

									

											<p>The UK is one of the World's most popular immigration destinations for people wishing to live and work in a new country. However, the UK's immigration system is restrictive. From 2008 to 2010 the UK's five-tier, points-based visa system was phased in, which measures applicants against various criteria designed to assess their eligibility for a UK work or study visa. Most work-related visa applications, as well as Tier 4 study visa applications, are now made through this system.</p>
											

											
									


									  <p>Since 2010 the UK government has made a series of changes to UK immigration law in order to restrict immigration to the UK, especially from outside of the EEA.</p>
