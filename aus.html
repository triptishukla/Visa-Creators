							<h3>TOURIST VISA</h3>
							<P><H4>Australian Temporary Work Visas</h4></p>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-md-12">
									<p>Australian temporary work visas such as the 457 work visa and working holidaymaker subclass 417 visa may be better options in many cases than the permanent skilled immigration categories. </p>

									<p>1. 457 Work Visa: for skilled workers who want to work in Australia for up to 4 years. Workers must be sponsored by an employer to obtain this visa. The Australian Subclass 457 Work Visa allows Australian and overseas employers to sponsor an immigrant worker to enter Australia for up to 4 years in order to engage in skilled work. The visa holder's family members can also gain entry to Australia, and may work and/or study during their stay. Once a person enters Australia on a 457 work visa, there is no limit to the number of times he or she can enter and leave the country during the time frame of his or her visa.</p>
									<p>    2. Working Holiday visa (Subclass 417): a very popular option for young people from around the world, this visa allows those aged 18-30 to have an extended holiday in Australia while working to supplement their income. The Australia's working holiday maker visa scheme allows young people to have an extended holiday while supplementing their travel funds through incidental employment, thus experiencing closer contact with the local community and promoting international understanding.</p>
									<p><h4>Work and study conditions</h4></p>
									<p>Working holiday makers are permitted to study or train for up to 4 months in Australia, and can work under certain conditions. You are allowed to do any kind of work of a temporary or casual nature. Since the main purpose of the visit is for holiday and travel, work for longer than 6 months with any one employer is not permitted. Working holiday makers should be paid according to Australian award rates and conditions.</p>
