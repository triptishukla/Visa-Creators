Many of those who aspire to live a better life prefer this country over others. The stable political climate gives the residents a sense of security and safety.

							<h3>Education in USA  </h3>
							
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-md-12">
									<p>Education in the USA is valued everywhere in the world. Some of the world’s top educational institutions are in the USA. Students who come to study in the USA can choose from over 3800 universities and colleges that facilitate several educational programs. There are both public and private universities which are well recognized for their excellence in providing education in the USA. </p>

									<p>Education in all streams is available. Since multiple options are available students, who study in the USA, can focus on specific areas of their interest. The advantage of obtaining an education in the USA is that they can move to another university, city, or state, and can change field at any time during their study often without wasting or losing any credits.</p>
									
									<p><h4>Entry Criterion to Study in USA</h4></p>
									<p>Academic requirement – Candidates who intend to study in the USA for their undergraduate program will require 10+2 or equivalent educational qualification, and SAT scores. Students intending to study in the USA for a Master’s program require 16-year education (4-year bachelor’s degree or equivalent). Some universities that education in the USA also requires GRE scores (Graduate Record Examination) for engineering related courses.</p>

									<P>Past academic record in the same field is preferable although students can change their field of study if they can substantiate it through a strong SOP (Statement of Purpose). Admission into management field is open to all students who study in the USA.

							<h3>US Student F-1 and M-1 Visa Categories</h3>
							
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-md-12">


                                     
									
									<p>This popularity could have made the US student visa system extremely complex, but luckily the system is streamlined. In fact there are only 2 main visas for full time students:</p>

									<p>    1. F-1 Visa for full time students studying at an academic institution such as a school, college, or university. The F-1 visa is the most popular route to studying in the US, and covers all full time academic education; from primary school to university. Students on this visa must have a confirmed place at a recognized primary/elementary school, secondary school, or university. This visa cannot be used to attend publicly funded primary schools or adult education programs.
</p>

									<p>M-1 visa for full time students studying at a non-academic or vocational institution, such as a technical college. The M-1 visa allows international students to enter the US to study on a full time vocational course at a recognized technical college or other educational institution. This visa cannot be used to study academic courses, such as degrees.</p>

									
<p>Generally to enter the US in the long term you need to have a high level job offer, or start a business or apply as an immigrant relative.   We find that the most popular work related visa categories are E-2 treaty investor, L-1A and L-1B intra company transfer, B-1 in lieu of H-1B and H-1B visa.   For employment based immigration one of the best options is the EB1-C for international executives and managers.</P>

They have to keep up their understudy visa status by finishing at least 15 hours of classroom examines every week at the University in which they are enlisted. The Career Services division in the Universities gives help to the understudies in finding. This program is exceptionally authorized by the US movement direction. Schools with this program are approved to issue work licenses for full-time off-grounds work from the earliest starting point of the graduate examinations.

    <p>Treaty Trader visa scheme.  For those looking for permanent residence with at least $500,000 to spend the EB-5 immigrant investor visa scheme is worth considering. </p>

							<h3>B1/B2 TOURIST VISA</h3>
						
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-md-12">
                                <p>Business travelers may enter the United States using a B-1 'Visitor for Business' Visa. Typically these visas are issued as joint B-1 business visit visa and B-2 ‘Visitor for Pleasure' (i.e. Tourist) visa. This practice means that, if you have an old B-1/B-2 visa originally issued for a tourist trip, it may be valid for a planned business trip.</p>
                                <p>  If you are a national of a Country that comes under the B-1/B-2 visa-waiver scheme for visits to the US for ninety days or less you should probably apply online using ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization). This avoids the necessity of applying for a B-1/B-2 visit visa at the US Embassy in person. </p>
                               <P><H4>B-1 Business Visitor Eligible activities</h4></p>
                               	<p>While in the US as a business visitor, an individual may.</p>
                               	<p>       1. Conduct Negotiations 
    2. Solicit sales or investment 
    3. Discuss planned investment or purchases. 
    4. Make investments or purchases 
    5. Attend Meetings, and participate in them fully. 
    6. Interview and hire staff. 
    7. Conduct research.</p>

                             <P><H4>Length of stay</h4></p>
                             	<p>Those entering on visitor visas will generally be granted 6 months admission on entry, though the maximum allowable stay is 1 year. It may be possible to obtain a six-month extension to the visit visa as long as the candidate will be maintaining visitor status, and there are good reasons to do so. It is sometimes possible to change status to another longer - term visa whilst in the US as a visitor, as long as the candidate advised the relevant US Embassy or Consulate of this possibility beforehand, or there was no pre-conceived intent to do so.</p>
                             	<P><H4>Applications</H4></P>
                             	<p>  US Visitor Visas should generally be applied for in a country of which the candidate is a Citizen or permanent resident. Applications made in other countries often run a high risk of being turned down. The most common reason for refusal of B1/B2 visas is the applicant showing insufficient evidence of social, family or economic ties to his/her country of residence that would ensure that s/he would return there following the visit to the USA.</p>

                             	<P>If the necessary conditions are satisfied then the applicant can apply for a visa. If you would like to find out if you qualify, you may fill out our US visa assessment form.</P>

<P><H4>The B-1/B-2 Visit Visa Waiver Pilot Program:</P></H4>
<p>The B-1/B-2 Visa Waiver Pilot Program allows citizens of certain countries to visit the US for up to 90 days without a Visitor Visa. To check if your country is on the list, and for full details, please see our US B-1 and B-2 Visitor Visa Waiver Pilot Program page. </p>
<p><h4>The B-1 in lieu of an H-1B</h4></p>
<p>In certain, limited circumstances the US Consulate may grant a B-1 Business Visitor Visa for work which would normally require and H-1B Work Visa. This provision can be useful when a non-US company wants to send someone to undertake a specific and limited project for a US-based client, or where an employee from a US subsidiary or affiliate company is needed for a short period. </p>
<p>
B-1 visas are significantly easier and quicker to obtain for these purposes than the heavily oversubscribed H-1B visa. For full details please see our US B-1 in lieu of H-1B visa page. The venture design and the buy of tickets can't be made until the point when the visa is conceded. There is no sort of subsidiary status given to the B1/B2 Visas. Thus, the relatives of the individual ought to autonomously fit the bill for this visa.</P>
<p>
Helping a family member, whether it is your spouse, fiancé (e), child, parent or brother or sister, become a permanent resident of the US, follows roughly the same procedure as outlined below. It may seem straightforward, but there are many nuances in each type of family-based visa. Please read our site carefully, and if you have any questions, please contact us for more information on family based immigration to the US.
